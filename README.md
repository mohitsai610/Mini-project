An Exam Seating Auto-Generation System is designed to automatically assign seats to students during exams based on various criteria. The system typically considers factors such as student roll numbers, departmental divisions, seating capacity. The goal is to streamline the seating arrangement process, reduce errors, and ensure fairness in seating distribution.
